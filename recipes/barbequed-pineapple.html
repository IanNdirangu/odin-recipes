    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Barbecued, marinated pineapple! Serve in a bowl or a banana boat with pineapple on either side, a scoop of ice
        cream or two on top, and drizzled with the remaining marinade glaze.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 fresh pineapple</li>
        <li>¼ cup rum</li>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and core whole pineapple, then slice into eight rings. Place pineapple rings in a shallow dish or
            resealable plastic bag. Mix together rum, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves in a small bowl.
            Pour marinade over pineapple. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove pineapple rings from the dish and reserve remaining marinade for serving.</li>
        <li>Grill pineapple rings until dry and char-marked, about 7 minutes on each side. Serve with remaining
            marinade.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><em><strong>Recipe Tip: </strong>For the drizzling glaze, you can substitute a half cup of fruit juice for the
            sugar and rum in the marinade.</em></p>
